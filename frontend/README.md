# Book Assignment View

Where teachers can assign books to students.

- Utilized [Atomic Design Pattern](https://bradfrost.com/) for organizing and structuring the application.

Advantages of Atomic Design

- Promotes usability - By breaking down interfaces into the smallest parts, it becomes easier to reuse components and leverage modular composition across different parts of an application or even across different projects.
- Ensure consistency - Atomic Design helps maintain UI consistency, which is crucial for user experience and brand identity.
- Facilitates Maintenance - When components are well-organized, it becomes much simpler to update and maintain them over time.
- Improve Collaboration - A shared design language based on Atomic Design principles can enhance communication, usage and contributions since itâ€™s easier to understand the codebase.
- Promotes Code Quality - As we create a sub-ecosystem for each component feature, each component or service has its isolated environment, including styles, actions, and tests. This isolation makes testing more effective and ensures consistent code quality.
